# Audiobook MP3 Speed Converter 🎧

Fast, in-browser MP3 speed adjustments powered by FFmpeg WASM—no installs needed.

## What it does
- Drop multiple MP3s and set a new playback speed (0.5x–2.0x).
- Convert and download files individually or bundled as a ZIP 📦.
- See per-file and global progress, plus time saved estimates.

## How to use
1) Open the [demo](https://andre-wojtowicz.github.io/audiobook-speed).
2) Drag & drop your MP3 files (or click to select).
3) Choose the new playback speed and hit convert—download as separate files or one ZIP.

## Notes
- Runs entirely in the browser using WebAssembly (no uploads to a server).
- Conversion uses FFmpeg; metadata is preserved.
- For large batches, keep the tab active to avoid throttling.

## Disclaimer
This app was vibe-coded with ChatGPT and Codex—use at your own discretion. 🚀
